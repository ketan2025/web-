I believe in having natural and unrefined beauty. I believe that a person should be naturally beautiful instead of caking on make-up, going to tanning beds regularly, dying hair to be a different color, or having surgery to “enhance” a perfectly beautiful body. Every person is beautiful in his or her own way, and I believe people should embrace their natural beauty instead of masking it with make-up, tanning, surgery, and other ways. In this day and age, beauty is everything. If you do not look like a celebrity, then you won’t fit in. It really makes me sad that people want to be exactly like a celebrity, when in reality he or she is naturally beautiful.

Make-up and cosmetics are some of the biggest industries of the world and it seems like people just cannot get enough of it. However, I do have to agree that some make-up, such as mineral make-up, is great to use because it is actually healthy for your skin. In these days, women pile on the make-up so that they look like clowns, and then at the end of the day their faces look like they are falling off. If the women who use make-up excessively knew the facts about the damage it does to the skin, then they might essentially switch to mineral make-up or use less. Most people think that make-up is helping them look younger or it accentuates them, but in all actuality make-up ages the skin and hides away the true beauty.

I really don’t think there is any way to express to someone how much I absolutely hate tanning beds. Whenever I hear the words “tanning bed,” my stomach starts churning and my body just cringes in disgust. Tanning beds have ruined America’s teenagers and young adults. Do people not know what tanning does to your skin and body? I guess they have no clue that it causes both serious and non serious types of skin cancer, let alone any other diseases that a person could get from lying down in an unsanitary bed. Is having that bronze or tan glow really worth risking your health for? Having that golden bronze complexion might seem beautiful now, but the repercussions of using a tanning bed will have a greater effect on the body in the future. Tanning is very dangerous, and most people do not realize the dangers in using a tanning bed, or as I like call it, a cancer death bed. I know that it is necessary for optimum health to have a certain amount of sunlight on a daily basis, but this type of sun should come directly from the outside sun and not the fake one in which the bulbs have to be replaced regularly. Tanning is extremely harmful, and it does not bring out the natural beauty of a person.

Hair dye is one of the worst inventions ever. Most people pride themselves on their hair because it is one of the most natural things our bodies produce. Having healthy hair is very important for good heath; it makes people have good self-esteem, knowing that they have good and healthy hair. In fact, when people get their hair dyed, it actually damages the healthy hair and it will not grow back as healthy as it once was. Every day when I am walking to class, I notice the color of peoples’ hair and I ask myself: Is that the natural color or did that come straight from a bottle? My philosophy on hair color is that the person who created you, gave you this hair color, so don’t go changing it; just let it be natural.
